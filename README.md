# Lo-Fi-Station
a little school project, my first "big" project. my thanks to codemy.com channel

## Requirements
Python 3.x and Libs: Pygame, Tkinter

## Installation 
assuming you already have python installed
on your computer:
```bash
$ pip install tk
$ pip install pygame
$ chmod +x 'lofi_station.py'
$ python3 'lofi_station.py'
```

## Important
for proper functioning it is important that the original files are not altered (neither name nor directories)
notice: I haven't tested Windows compatibility so it might not work
disclaimer: I'm not the owner/creator of the assets used in this project like the background, rain sound.
All credits to them, I just created the button icons and code

## Curiosity
in the music widget there are two options: "Add a song" and "Add several songs".
This happens because I had to create a second option to "Add a song" where I could add songs in sequences by dragging and selecting with the mouse

it turned out to be a useless option because it didn't work. :|
If I come back one day to edit this code, that option will be removed.
this was my first major project i did for a school project. 
I did it with the purpose of training my knowledge with programming. 
I made it based on the Codemy channel code
